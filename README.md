Kazu is a tool to help people who are learning Japanese to read numbers. Numbers in Japanese are grouped by 4 instead of 3, which can make reading large numbers difficult. Kazu aims to help by allowing the user to experiment and see the differences immediately.

It could also be used by Japanese speakers who want to practice reading numbers in English.
